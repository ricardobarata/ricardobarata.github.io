I love to listen to Turbowolf. The craziest things I remember doing include skydiving in Portugal and going to the Alps for a 170km hike with 10km ascent/descent with a one layer festival tent. Moving to another country to live in is not very far off. I've been in the UK for roughly {{ years }} years, living in Bristol, one of the coolest cities of England. I enjoy the challenges of coding both for work or my own projects."
